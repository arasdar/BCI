    "# Export epochs to Pandas DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example the pandas exporter will be used to produce a DataFrame\n",
    "object. After exploring some basic features a split-apply-combine\n",
    "work flow will be conducted to examine the latencies of the response\n",
    "maxima across epochs and conditions.\n",
    "Note. Equivalent methods are available for raw and evoked data objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Short Pandas Primer\n",
    "-------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas Data Frames\n",
    "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n",
    "A data frame can be thought of as a combination of matrix, list and dict:\n",
    "It knows about linear algebra and element-wise operations but is size mutable\n",
    "and allows for labeled access to its data. In addition, the pandas data frame\n",
    "class provides many useful methods for restructuring, reshaping and visualizing\n",
    "data. As most methods return data frame instances, operations can be chained\n",
    "with ease; this allows to write efficient one-liners. Technically a DataFrame\n",
    "can be seen as a high-level container for numpy arrays and hence switching\n",
    "back and forth between numpy arrays and DataFrames is very easy.\n",
    "Taken together, these features qualify data frames for inter operation with\n",
    "databases and for interactive data exploration / analysis.\n",
    "Additionally, pandas interfaces with the R statistical computing language that\n",
    "covers a huge amount of statistical functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Export Options\n",
    "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n",
    "The pandas exporter comes with a few options worth being commented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas DataFrame objects use a so called hierarchical index. This can be\n",
    "thought of as an array of unique tuples, in our case, representing the higher\n",
    "dimensional MEG data in a 2D data table. The column names are the channel names\n",
    "from the epoch object. The channels can be accessed like entries of a\n",
    "dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "    df['MEG 2333']\n",
    "\n",
    "Epochs and time slices can be accessed with the .ix method:\n",
    "\n",
    "    epochs_df.ix[(1, 2), 'MEG 2333']\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is also possible to include this index as regular categorial data\n",
    "columns which yields a long table format typically used for repeated measure\n",
    "designs. To take control of this feature, on export, you can specify which\n",
    "of the three dimensions 'condition', 'epoch' and 'time' is passed to the Pandas\n",
    "index using the index parameter. Note that this decision is revertible any\n",
    "time, as demonstrated below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, for convenience, it is possible to scale the times, e.g. from\n",
    "seconds to milliseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some Instance Methods\n",
    "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n",
    "Most numpy methods and many ufuncs can be found as instance methods, e.g.\n",
    "mean, median, var, std, mul, , max, argmax etc.\n",
    "Below an incomplete listing of additional useful data frame instance methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "apply : apply function to data.\n",
    "    Any kind of custom function can be applied to the data. In combination with\n",
    "    lambda this can be very useful.\n",
    "describe : quickly generate summary stats\n",
    "    Very useful for exploring data.\n",
    "groupby : generate subgroups and initialize a 'split-apply-combine' operation.\n",
    "    Creates a group object. Subsequently, methods like apply, agg, or transform\n",
    "    can be used to manipulate the underlying data separately but\n",
    "    simultaneously. Finally, reset_index can be used to combine the results\n",
    "    back into a data frame.\n",
    "plot : wrapper around plt.plot\n",
    "    However it comes with some special options. For examples see below.\n",
    "shape : shape attribute\n",
    "    gets the dimensions of the data frame.\n",
    "values :\n",
    "    return underlying numpy array.\n",
    "to_records :\n",
    "    export data as numpy record array.\n",
    "to_dict :\n",
    "    export data as dict of arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference\n",
    "~~~~~~~~~\n",
    "More information and additional introductory materials can be found at the\n",
    "pandas doc sites: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/\n",
