    FIR filter design using least squares method.
    
    Inputs :
        m : oder of FIR filter

        bands : A montonic sequence containing the band edges.  All elements
                must be non-negative and less than 1 the sampling frequency
                as given in pi units.
        desired : A sequency with the same size of bands containing the desired gain
        in each of the specified bands
        weight : A relative weighting to give to each band region.
    
    Output :
        h  : coefficients of length m+1 fir filter.
    
    Example :
        h = firls(50, [0,0.2,0.3,1.0], [1,1,0,0],[1,5.0])
